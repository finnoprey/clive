Before continuing on with this README, it is important to provide some background information regarding what Clive Bot is really all about.

# The Small Things in Life
Going to the footy with mates, enjoying a beer down at the pub, the feeling of the sea breeze running through your hair. These are things that unite us as people. Clive Bot is simply helping build unity around the world. The Pin is a fantastic comedy duo (https://twitter.com/thepincomedy) which has helped bring great joy to the lives of many during the COVID-19 Pandemic. A sketch they published on May 25th, 2020 is truly a work of art. You can view the original sketch at [this tweet](https://twitter.com/thepincomedy/status/1264856317153497088?s=20&t=2vCf3RwZ6ZiIQEbuWagN6Q). I'm confident you'll agree it is just what the world needed at the height of a pandemic and an explosion in at-home working. So it is through Clive Bot that we hope to share this exceptional piece of comedic genius with as many people as possible, and give it the attention it deserves.

# Our Community
To be involved in the community supporting James' efforts to mute himself, you can join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ckgu8Dg26y) and get involved today! Clive Bot will send a reminder to the server's members at exactly 20:45:06 AEST, where members are encouraged to gather their mates around to share the special moment. Our members are incredibly enthusiastic and all are welcome. It is truly a sight to behold.

# Where To Go From Here?
We are actively investigating many paths to take Clive Bot, such as new chat responses and commands. These will help improve the interactivity of Clive Bot, and therefore improve the experience of our members. But these features are useless without a community ready to use them, so join up and get ready for big things in the future!

We welcome others to contribute their ideas for features in the discord, or by making a fork of this repository in order to develop one themselves. **ALL FEATURES WILL BE HEAVILY SCRUTINISED BEFORE IMPLEMENTATION SO DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT TRYING TO SNEAK ANY NEFARIOUS FEATURES PAST OUR TEAM!!** The Clive Bot Team is dedicated to upholding an extremely high standard when it comes to these sorts of matters, as Alex Owen and Ben Ashenden would wish.

# Some Final Words
In conclusion, it does not matter who you are or where you come from... Anyone can experience the blissfully delightful elation brought about by the viewing of "Secret Zoom Hack". James, Clive, and Frank unite us all. Thank you for your time, and hope to see you at 20:45:06 AEST.
